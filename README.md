# Basic Calculator

This is a Python-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## How to Use
1. Run the script: `python basic_calculator.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to input numbers and select operations.
3. Continue calculations or start a new one as prompted.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `art` Python package (`pip install art`)

## Features
- Interactive input for numbers and operations.
- Dynamic results storage for chained calculations.
- Validations for operations.

## Example:
- Enter the first number: 10
- Enter the second number: 20
- Choose an operation: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division: +
- The result is: 30

## Planned Improvements:
	•	Add input validation for numbers to handle non-integer inputs.
	•	Handle division by zero gracefully with error messages.
	•	Enhance the user interface by adding a menu for operation selection.
	•	Include more mathematical operations like modulus, exponentiation, and square root.
	•	Refactor the repetition handling logic to reduce redundancy.
	•	Add tests to validate functionality for all operations.
